# Komodo Wallet v0.9.3 Release Notes

This release sharpens sign-in convenience, analytics coverage, and operational resilience ahead of the 0.9.3 cut. Highlights include one-click remember-me login, a dual analytics pipeline with Matomo support, a hardened feedback workflow, and improved compliance guardrails across platforms.

## üöÄ New Features
- **One-Click Remember Me Sign-In** ([@CharlVS], #3041) - Adds a quick login toggle that remembers hashed wallet metadata, auto-detects password manager autofill, and lets you resume the last wallet in one tap across desktop and mobile.

## üé® UI & UX

- **Token Parent Labeling** ([@smk762], #2988) - Marks parent chains as native, adopts SDK display names, and keeps network suffixes visible across wallet views.
- **DEX Address Pill Consistency** ([@smk762], #2974) - Aligns the address pill style between list and detail flows for clearer swap confirmations.
- **Coin Detail Fiat Per Address** ([@takenagain], #3049) - Restores fiat balance context for individual addresses on the coin detail screen.
- **Memo Field Contextualization** ([@smk762], #2998) - Only renders memo inputs for Tendermint and ZHTLC assets so other withdrawals stay clutter-free.

## üîí Security & Compliance
- **Geo Blocker Bouncer Integration** ([@CharlVS], #3150) - Streams the new trading-status API, filters blocked assets during wallet bootstrap, and exposes an override for regulated builds.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **NFT IPFS Fallbacks** ([@takenagain], #3020) - Introduces an IPFS gateway manager with retries, cooldowns, and unit tests so NFT media loads consistently.
- **SDK Disposal Crash** ([@DeckerSU], #3117) - Avoids crashes when mm2 shuts down mid-fetch by guarding the periodic fetch loop.
- **Price/Version Reporting** ([@DeckerSU], #3115) - Ensures the settings screen shows the actual mm2 commit hash instead of a closure string.
