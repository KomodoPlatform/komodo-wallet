# Testing

The map of every automated-test surface in this repo: what exists, exactly how to run it,
and what gates a PR.

This file is **authoritative for commands**. It is a *pointer* for depth — the wallet-load
tiers live in [WALLET_LOAD_MEASUREMENT.md](WALLET_LOAD_MEASUREMENT.md), the KDF probes in
[tool/README.md](../tool/README.md), the QA rig's design in
[automated_testing/gleec-qa-architecture.md](../automated_testing/gleec-qa-architecture.md).
If a command here drifts from reality, fix it here first.

## 2. Unit and widget tests

```bash
flutter test test_units/main.dart \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_ENABLED=true \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_RECEIVE_ENABLED=true \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_BASE_URL=https://quicknode.gleec.com/gasfree/tron \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_SERVICE_PROVIDER=TLntW9Z59LYY5KEi9cmwk3PKjQga828ird
```

### The four defines are mandatory

Without them `tronGaslessServiceProvider` falls back to its empty default
(`lib/shared/constants.dart`), every GasFree provider-identity check fails closed, and
~36 gas-free tests never reach the state they `await`. They **hang rather than fail** —
an unbounded `bloc.stream.firstWhere` has no deadline — so the symptom is a wedged runner
and a CI timeout, not a red test. The values are non-secret; the source of record is
`.github/workflows/unit-tests-on-pr.yml:9-20` and `test_units/main.dart:101-114`.

### The aggregator trap

CI runs *only* `test_units/main.dart`. **A test file not reachable from it never runs,
anywhere, and nothing reports that.** Adding a test means adding an import there. Three
files are orphaned today — see §9.

### Coverage

`unit-tests-on-pr.yml` runs `flutter test` twice: the suite, then a `--coverage` pass via
`.github/actions/code-coverage` with the same four defines. Both are
`continue-on-error: false`, so a wedged coverage run reds the PR just as the suite would.
Change the defines in one place and you must change them in both.

## 3. Integration / GUI tests

`dart run_integration_tests.dart` wraps `flutter drive`. It starts and stops the browser
driver itself, so no manual `chromedriver` step is needed for Chrome.

### Flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Allowed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--help` | `-h` | — | — | prints usage, exits 0 |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | false | — | passes `-v` to `flutter drive` |
| `--testToRun` | `-t` | `''` | path under `test_integration/tests/` | **replaces** the whole default list |
| `--browserDimension` | `-b` | `1024,1400` | `H,W` | rewritten to `HxW`. Web only |
| `--displayMode` | `-d` | `no-headless` | `headless`, `no-headless` | local default opens a visible browser. Web only |
| `--device` | `-D` | `web-server` | `web-server`, `chrome`, `linux`, `macos`, `windows`, `ios`, `android` | anything but `web-server` takes the native path |
| `--runMode` | `-m` | `profile` | `release`, `debug`, `profile` | `profile` also emits `--profile-memory=memory_profile.json` |
| `--browser-name` | `-n` | `chrome` | `chrome`, `safari`, `firefox` | `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` pins the Chrome binary |
| `--driver-port` | `-p` | `4444` | — | web only |
| `--pub` | — | false | — | `flutter pub get` before each group |
| `--concurrent` | `-c` | false | — | not recommended with the current build steps |
| `--keep-running` | `-k` | false | — | maps to `--keep-app-running` |

**`-d` is display mode; `-D` is device.** They are not `flutter`'s letters. Getting them
backwards is the classic mistake here.

### What the runner injects — and what it does not

Exactly three defines, on both the native and web paths:

```
--dart-define=testing_mode=true       # lib/shared/constants.dart -> isTestMode
--dart-define=CI=true                 # -> isCiEnvironment
--dart-define=ANALYTICS_DISABLED=true # -> analyticsDisabled
```

**No `TRON_GASLESS_*` defines reach the integration suite.** GasFree is compiled off for
every integration run, so no integration test covers that rail. `testing_mode` itself only
changes error handling and log verbosity — it does not touch auth, analytics, or KDF
config.

### Suites

| Suite (`-t` path) | In the default run | Logs in via `restoreWalletToTest` |
|---|---|---|
| `wallets_tests/wallets_tests.dart` | yes | yes |
| `wallets_manager_tests/wallets_manager_tests.dart` | yes | **no** — it *is* the auth test; drives import directly |
| `dex_tests/dex_tests.dart` | yes | yes |
| `misc_tests/misc_tests.dart` | yes | yes, after the theme and feedback tests |
| `fiat_onramp_tests/fiat_onramp_tests.dart` | yes | yes |
| `nfts_tests/nfts_tests.dart` | **no** — `-t` only | yes |
| `no_login_tests/no_login_tests.dart` | **no** — `-t` only | mostly no, but see below |
| `suspended_assets_test/suspended_assets_test.dart` | **no** — hardcoded off | n/a |
| `perf_tests/perf_tests.dart` | **no** — `-t` only, by design (§7) | no |

`no_login_tests` is not entirely login-free: `no_login_taker_form_test.dart` calls
`restoreWalletToTest` and must stay last in its group.

### The test wallet

`test_integration/helpers/restore_wallet.dart` imports wallet `my-wallet` with password
`pppaaasssDDD555444@@@` in iguana mode. The seed is a randomly chosen **funded WIF key**
from `helpers/get_funded_wif.dart` — RICK/MORTY testnet keys, not secrets, not a BIP39
mnemonic. Because it is not a mnemonic, the helper must confirm the app's custom-seed
dialog. Legal acceptance is tied to the normal Create, final Import, Log in, or hardware
Continue submission beside the linked notice. Updated terms add an inline notice
to those same forms; there is no checkbox or separate acceptance step. Opening a
form or legal document does not record acceptance. Legal state, notice, and form
regressions are included in `test_units/main.dart`.

### Web vs native

The web path (`-D web-server`, the default) serves the app and drives a real browser via
chromedriver, which issues a **fresh browser profile per session** — so storage is clean
every run. The native path (`-D macos|linux|windows|…`) calls `clearNativeAppsData()`
first, but that function targets the wrong bundle identifiers (§9) — neither path should
be assumed to give a clean native profile.

### Recipes

```bash
dart run_integration_tests.dart -t 'wallets_tests/wallets_tests.dart'
dart run_integration_tests.dart -n safari -m release
dart run_integration_tests.dart -d headless -b '1600,1024' -n chrome -m profile  # = the Linux CI leg
dart run_integration_tests.dart -D macos -m debug
```

`Process.run` buffers all output until the run exits — nothing streams, not even the
build. With `-d no-headless` the visible browser window is your progress signal.

## 4. KDF wallet-load harness

Measures wallet load. **Why** the numbers are what they are lives in
[WALLET_LOAD_MEASUREMENT.md](WALLET_LOAD_MEASUREMENT.md); the package internals are in
[its README](../sdk/packages/komodo_defi_harness/README.md). Only the commands live here.

```bash
cd sdk/packages/komodo_defi_harness

# replay tier — what the PR gate runs, per wallet type
KDF_HARNESS_WALLET_TYPE=hd     flutter test --exclude-tags bench
KDF_HARNESS_WALLET_TYPE=iguana flutter test --exclude-tags bench

# benchmark + the gate's own comparison
KDF_HARNESS_WALLET_TYPE=hd BENCH_OUT=build/bench_result.json flutter test --tags bench
dart run tool/compare_bench.dart \
  --baseline tool/bench_baseline.json \
  --current build/bench_result.json \
  --max-regression 0.30

# process tier — nightly only, real binary, real electrum
KDF_HARNESS=1 KDF_TEST_SEED='<throwaway funded seed>' flutter test --tags process -j 1
```

- A bare `flutter test` here runs replay **and** bench; the process tier self-skips
  without `KDF_HARNESS`.
- `-j 1` on the process tier: the RPC port is shared and concurrent files race for it.
- `KDF_TEST_SEED` may only come from the environment. Never upload the harness workspace
  as a CI artifact — it contains a real wallet database.
- **Revert your tree afterwards.** `flutter test` rewrites `pubspec.lock`,
  `sdk/pubspec.lock`, and `sdk/packages/komodo_defi_framework/app_build/build_config.json`;
  the PR gate fails on a dirty tree.

## 5. SDK package tests

```bash
cd sdk/packages/komodo_defi_sdk && KDF_HARNESS="" flutter test
```

`KDF_HARNESS` must stay empty: the suite has no process-tier tests, but asset generation
fetches the KDF binary, so anything keying off binary-existence would spawn a real KDF.
The workflow is path-scoped to `sdk/**`, so an app-only PR never runs it.

Every other SDK package has tests and **no CI**: `komodo_cex_market_data`,
`komodo_defi_types`, `komodo_coin_updates`, `komodo_defi_rpc_methods`,
`komodo_wallet_build_transformer`, `komodo_coins`, `komodo_defi_framework`,
`dragon_charts_flutter`, `komodo_wallet_cli`, `komodo_ui`, `dragon_logs`,
`komodo_symbol_converter`, `komodo_legacy_wallet_migration`. Run them by hand or they ship
unverified. `komodo_defi_local_auth` is the one *deliberate* exclusion — see §9.

## 6. Skyvern QA runner

Vision-based E2E against a **deployed** web build. See
[automated_testing/README.md](../automated_testing/README.md) for the runbook and
prerequisites; the architecture is in `automated_testing/gleec-qa-architecture.md`.

```bash
cd automated_testing
python -m runner.runner --tag smoke --single
```

It is **not wired into CI** — nothing under `.github/` references `automated_testing`.

## 7. Frame timing

Frame-rate and jank measurement. Two tiers, both opt-in.

```bash
# automated: opt-in target, native profile build
dart run_integration_tests.dart -t perf_tests/perf_tests.dart -D macos -m profile
cat build/frame_result.json

# field: in-app recorder, writes into the diagnostic log
fvm flutter run -d macos --profile --dart-define=FRAME_TIMING_CAPTURE=true
# then Settings -> Diagnostic Logging, reproduce, Download Logs
dart run tool/parse_wallet_load_log.dart ~/Downloads/<log-file>
```

A jank frame is one where `max(buildDuration, rasterDuration)` exceeds the frame budget
(`1000 / refreshRate` ms); severe at 3×. **The budget is device-dependent** — 16.67ms at
60Hz, 8.33ms at 120Hz ProMotion — so every result carries its own `refresh_hz`, and
results measured against different budgets are different quantities, not noisier ones.

`-D macos -m profile` is the authoritative target. Debug timings are meaningless (JIT,
asserts on); web CanvasKit raster is a different quantity and KDF shares the main thread
there; headless Linux CI rasterizes in software.

### Read the yield, not just the jank ratio

Build and raster durations only describe frames that **happened**. On web a long task
stops the frame happening at all — the browser never fires the rAF — so a blocked main
thread produces *fewer* frames rather than slower ones, and the jank ratio reads as
healthy while the UI is visibly frozen. Both capture paths therefore also report the
frame-arrival view, from `computeFrameGapMetrics`:

| field | reads as |
|---|---|
| `gap_p50_ms` | when the app painted, did it paint on time — **the gate** |
| `gap_worst_ms` | longest single stretch with nothing painted |
| `yield_pct` | frames painted ÷ frames offered — informational, see below |
| `stall_ms` / `missed_frames` | total time, and refresh slots, that painted nothing |
| `ui_ms` / `raster_total_ms` | Flutter's own share of the span |

**Yield is not a gate.** It only means "the UI froze" in a window where
something animated the whole time. The hermetic scroll flow measures ~30% yield
across runs with a median gap of one frame budget — it painted perfectly and had
nothing to do between flings. The median gap is the honest test, because idle
cannot move it; `gap_worst_ms` catches outright freezes.

`ui` and `raster` are reported separately and **must not be summed on native**, where
raster is a different thread that pipelines with the next frame's build — the two can
exceed the span. On web they are the same thread and do add up to Flutter's share.

A capture can legitimately show `PASS` on jank and `FAIL` on yield. That combination is
the signature of a blocked main thread, not a contradiction.

The `frames[<span>][attrib]` line names what blocked it, from a `long-animation-frame`
observer. Chrome-only, with a 50ms floor, and it credits a task to its entry point — so
wasm called synchronously from Dart is charged to `dart-app` and the KDF figure is a
**floor**. Non-Chrome reports `attribution none` rather than zeroes.

### Spans

| span | window |
|---|---|
| `wallet_load` | `signed_in` → `first_balance` |
| `activation_storm` | the whole initial activation fan-out, from `CoinsBloc` |
| `login_activation_storm` | the driven equivalent, integration suite only |

`activation_storm` exists because `first_balance` is defined as *one* asset having both a
balance and a price, so `wallet_load` closes while the rest of the fan-out is still
running — which is where the jank is.

Spans report **600ms after they close**, not immediately: the engine only flushes
`FrameTiming` when a new frame is submitted and the batch is over ~100ms old, so reporting
on close silently discards the tail — the jankiest part of a stall.

### The login flow

Off by default; it needs a funded seed and network, takes minutes, and is not repeatable
inside one app instance (the second login activates from warm caches):

```bash
dart run_integration_tests.dart -t perf_tests/perf_tests.dart -m profile \
  --dart-define=PERF_LOGIN_ACTIVATION=true
```

Login is driven *before* the measured window opens. `measureFramesUntil` switches the
binding to `benchmarkLive`, under which `pump()` requests are ignored — otherwise the
driving loop manufactures the very frames it is counting — and `restoreWalletToTest` needs
those pumps honoured. The two cannot share a window.

### Running it here: use the pinned SDK

`run_integration_tests.dart` invokes bare `flutter`, which resolves through `PATH`, while
`.fvmrc` pins the project to a different version. The mismatch surfaces as a compile error
inside `flutter_test` (`_TestFlutterView` missing a `FlutterView` member), which looks like
a code problem and is not. Until the runner is taught to respect FVM, drive it directly:

```bash
chromedriver --port=4444 --silent &
fvm flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
  --target=test_integration/tests/perf_tests/perf_tests.dart \
  -d web-server --browser-name chrome --no-headless --driver-port=4444 \
  --profile --dart-define=testing_mode=true --dart-define=CI=true \
  --dart-define=ANALYTICS_DISABLED=true
```

**Check the artifact, not the exit code** (§9.1): the runner has been observed exiting 0
on a run whose build failed outright. Confirm `END PERF TESTS` printed and that
`build/frame_result.json` has a fresh mtime.

This is deliberately **not** in the default suite list: it costs seconds per measurement
window, asserts nothing about correctness, and a perf target that reds a functional CI run
trains people to ignore functional CI.

### There is no baseline yet, on purpose

`tool/frame_baseline.json` does not exist. Recording one requires an authoritative run,
and `-D macos -m profile` currently cannot build here — the Debug/Profile configuration
has no provisioning profile (§9). Committing a web-measured baseline would be worse than
having none: it would pin a number from a different renderer on a thread KDF shares.

When the macOS provisioning is fixed, take a run, commit it as `tool/frame_baseline.json`
mirroring the shape of `sdk/packages/komodo_defi_harness/tool/bench_baseline.json`, and
give it a `_comment` block stating which display it was measured on, that it is **never
auto-updated**, and which flows are structurally un-gateable (activation is network-bound;
route-open always carries the first-frame outlier).

Phase 2 — the activation and chart-render flows, a `tool/compare_frames.dart` comparator,
and an informational job in `kdf-harness-nightly.yml` — is deliberately deferred. Gating
needs ~20 nightly samples first: a 30% tolerance on a 3ms p90 is a 0.9ms band, narrower
than scheduling noise on a shared runner, and a flaky perf gate gets ignored within a
fortnight. The chart flow additionally needs keys added to
`packages/komodo_ui_kit/lib/src/inputs/time_period_selector.dart`, which today has none.

## 8. Which suite do I run?

| Change | Run | Also consider |
|---|---|---|
| Pure Dart logic in `lib/` | unit | — |
| A BLoC or its states/events | unit | integration, if it drives a screen a suite touches |
| A widget carrying a `Key` a test uses | unit **and** integration | grep `test_integration/` for the key first |
| Anything GasFree / TRON | unit **with all four defines** | integration will not cover it — no defines injected |
| Auth, activation, pubkeys, balances, storage | SDK **and** harness replay | nightly process tier if it touches the real binary |
| Anything that could move wallet-load timing | harness replay + bench | update `tool/bench_baseline.json` by hand in the same PR |
| An RPC request/response type | SDK + harness replay | serialisation bugs surface only on transports that `jsonEncode` |
| An `sdk/packages/*` package other than `komodo_defi_sdk` | that package's own `flutter test` | not gated — run it or it ships unverified |
| Login / wallet-manager / DEX / fiat UI flows | integration | `-t` a single suite while iterating |
| List, chart, or animation rendering | frame timing (§7) | unit for the logic underneath |
| Full regression on a deployed build | Skyvern | needs the rig; not CI |
| Docs, comments, CI YAML only | none | `flutter analyze` still gates |

## 9. Known-broken and not-run

Current as of the last audit. Each is a real defect, not a caveat.

> Three entries were removed on 2026-08-27 after verifying they had been fixed on this
> branch: the `pumpUntilDisappear` timeout is now a `timeout` parameter defaulting to 60s
> (`widget_tester_pump_extension.dart:55`), `clearNativeAppsData()` uses the Gleec bundle
> ids (`app_data.dart:16-17`), and nothing references `active-coin-item-` any more.

1. **The integration suite reports green when a test throws.** `app.main()` sets
   `FlutterError.onError = catchUnhandledExceptions` (`lib/main.dart:65-67`), and that
   handler **never rethrows when `isTestMode` is true** (`lib/main.dart:186-194`) — which
   the runner always makes true via `--dart-define=testing_mode=true`. It replaces the
   handler `testWidgets` installed to record failures, so the throw is printed to the
   browser console and the run still ends `All tests passed!`. Observed directly: a
   `misc_tests` run where `testFeedbackForm` died on `Bad state: No element`, never
   reached `restoreWalletToTest`, never printed its own `END MISC TESTS`, and exited 0.
   **Do not trust a green integration run** — read the browser console
   (`chromedriver.log`) and confirm the suite's final marker actually printed.
2. **Three `test_units/` files are orphaned** and never run anywhere:
   `tests/wallet/legacy_native_wallet_migration_test.dart`,
   `views/wallets_manager/widgets/legacy_migration_compatibility_dialog_test.dart`,
   `views/settings/widgets/security_settings/legacy_migration_cleanup_plate_test.dart`.
   `testTruncateDecimal()` is also commented out in `test_units/main.dart`.
3. **The macOS Debug/Profile configuration has no provisioning profile.** A
   `-D macos -m profile` run fails at `No profiles for 'com.GleecDEX.wallet' were found`.
   Only the Release configuration (bundle id `com23.GleecDEX.wallet`, Developer ID
   signing) is set up. Until that is fixed, the native perf target of §7 cannot run
   locally, and web is the only path — with the caveat there that web frame numbers are
   not baseline-worthy.
4. **`--timeout=600` is inert.** `flutter drive` only arms that timer when `--screenshot`
   is passed, which the runner never does. A hung integration test has no wrapper-level
   cap; only a test's own `Timeout` bounds it.
5. **`suspended_assets_test` is hardcoded off** (`getTestsList(false)`). The `*.cipig.net`
   URL-blocking machinery is intact but unreachable.
6. **`nfts_tests` and `no_login_tests` are not in the default list** — `-t` only, so they
   run only when someone remembers.
7. **Integration coverage is disabled** in `ui-tests-on-pr.yml` — Hive and other storage
   providers need mocking, and `flutter drive` is deprecated upstream.
8. **`komodo_defi_local_auth` is deliberately ungated** — 57 pass, 1 fails
   (`trezor_repository_test.dart`). Unresolved: either a stale fixture or a real loss of
   device-error detail.
9. **`test/gasless_journal_web_key_discovery_test.dart` is `@TestOn('browser')`** and no
   workflow runs it: `flutter test --platform chrome test/…`.
10. **No integration coverage of the GasFree rail** — §3.
11. **Skyvern is not in CI** — §6.
