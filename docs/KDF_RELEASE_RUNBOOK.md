# Shipping a KDF change to the app

End-to-end runbook for taking a change in the Rust KDF and getting it in front
of the app: push → build all seven targets → publish to Cloudflare R2 → point
the SDK at it → verify it actually arrived → validate it in the app.

Three repos are involved and none of them is a submodule of another:

| repo | role |
|---|---|
| `komodo-defi-framework` (sibling checkout) | the Rust source. **All code edits happen here.** |
| `nitride-kdf-builds` (sibling checkout) | builds the seven platform artifacts and publishes them |
| this repo | consumes the artifact, and holds the probes/harness that validate it |

> **Only doing local measurement, not shipping?** You do not need any of this.
> Edit in the KDF checkout, `cargo build --release --target
> aarch64-apple-darwin --bin kdf`, and point the probe at the binary with
> `--kdf`. Use the existing sibling checkout rather than a fresh clone — it
> carries a warm Cargo `target/` (~200 GB), which is a ~5 minute incremental
> build against ~45 minutes cold, and you will rebuild many times. Method:
> [`WALLET_LOAD_MEASUREMENT.md`](WALLET_LOAD_MEASUREMENT.md).

## 0. Before you start

* **Docker running** (Linux and Android targets build in the upstream CI image).
* `wasm-pack`, `cargo-xwin`, `lipo` — `local_release.py --install-missing`
  installs the first two and the Rust targets.
* Publishing credentials, **one of**:
  * `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
    `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` → use `local_release.py deploy`, or
  * an authenticated `wrangler` session (`wrangler whoami`) → use
    `wrangler_backfill.py`.
* Budget ~40-60 min for a cold seven-target build. The Android leg alone
  downloads a 691 MB NDK.

## 1. Push the KDF branch

```bash
cd ../komodo-defi-framework
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

**`origin` only.** As of 2026-08-06 the clone has a single remote:

| remote | points at | push here? |
|---|---|---|
| `origin` | `GLEECBTC/kdf-internal` (private) | **yes** |

The public `GLEECBTC/komodo-defi-framework` is retired, and the
`CharlVS/komodo-defi-framework` fork and `KomodoPlatform` upstream have been
removed from the clone. `remote.pushDefault=origin` is set, so a bare
`git push` targets kdf-internal even if another remote is re-added later.

Note that the build in step 2 reads the **local working tree**, not a remote, so
a branch that has not been pushed anywhere still builds — but then the artefact's
only source of truth is your laptop.

---

## 2. Build all seven targets

```bash
cd ../nitride-kdf-builds
KDF_REPO=$(cd ../komodo-defi-framework && pwd)

python3 scripts/local_release.py run \
  --kdf-repo "$KDF_REPO" \
  --expect-commit "$(git -C "$KDF_REPO" rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --expect-branch "$(git -C "$KDF_REPO" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" \
  --install-missing --start-docker --no-serve
```

The `--expect-*` guards are the point: they fail the run if the checkout moves
underneath you, so the artifacts always correspond to a known commit.

Output lands in `public/<safe-branch>/` with a `manifest.json`. The run
self-validates — recomputes every SHA-256, tests each ZIP, checks architectures
with `file`/`lipo`/`llvm-objdump`, and runs the macOS universal binary with
`--version`.

> **The KDF worktree must be clean**, or the run refuses to start. If the dirt
> is untracked files that are *not* build inputs (notes, scratch scripts), add
> them to `.git/info/exclude` — local-only, never committed, and it preserves
> the guarantee that the build matches the commit. Do **not** delete someone's
> files, and do not exclude modified tracked files.

### Knowing when it finished

This takes 40–60 minutes, which is long enough that you will do something else
and come back. **Come back to the build's own state, not to a watcher.** Three
independent facts, all free:

```bash
LOG=<wherever you redirected the run>
grep -c "Cleanup audit passed" "$LOG"                    # 1 = finished cleanly
echo $(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -f %m "$LOG") ))           # seconds since last write
ls ../nitride-kdf-builds/public/<safe-branch>/manifest.json
```

A completed run ends with `Artifact validation passed.` and `Cleanup audit
passed.`; a failed one ends with a `ReleaseError` or a traceback. The log's
mtime separates "still working" from "died silently" — a build that has written
nothing for ten minutes is not building.

**This has been got wrong twice, in two different ways, and both cost real
time.** They are worth stating separately because fixing the first does not
prevent the second:

1. **A `pgrep -f` wait loop matched itself.** `while pgrep -f "local_release.py
   run"; do sleep 60; done` — `pgrep -f` matches the full command line of every
   process, *including the shell running the loop*, whose command line contains
   that exact string because you just typed it. The loop always finds one
   process and never exits. The build had finished 32 minutes earlier.
   If you must check for a process, make the pattern unmatchable by the wrapper:
   `pgrep -f "[l]ocal_release.py run"`.
2. **The watcher did not outlive the session; the build did.** The second time,
   the wait was on a log marker and the logic was correct — but the waiting
   shell was killed at a session boundary while the `nohup`-ed build kept
   running to a clean finish. No watcher was left to notice, and *no
   notification is not a signal*. The build sat done for two hours.

The generalisation that covers both: **a watcher is a convenience, never the
source of truth.** Re-derive state on every resume. It costs one `grep`.

> Do not try to wait it out in the foreground either. Long-running-command
> timeouts here are commonly capped at ten minutes, and a larger value is
> silently clamped — so a foreground wait on a 45-minute build always looks
> like a timeout, which tells you nothing about the build.

---

## 3. Publish to Cloudflare R2

With R2 S3 credentials:

```bash
python3 scripts/local_release.py deploy \
  --kdf-repo "$KDF_REPO" \
  --expect-commit "$KDF_COMMIT" --expect-branch "$KDF_BRANCH" \
  --platform all --provider cloudflare
```

With only a wrangler session — **dry run first**:

```bash
python3 scripts/wrangler_backfill.py --dry-run --jobs 4
python3 scripts/wrangler_backfill.py --jobs 4
```

Both are additive and never delete remote objects. `wrangler_backfill.py`
reuploads *all* selected keys including historical branches, so expect ~100
objects even for one new build.

Confirm the mirror actually serves it:

```bash
curl -s https://kdf-dev-builds.nitride.app/<safe-branch>/manifest.json | head -20
```

> `source_urls` in the SDK config historically leads with
> `https://nitride-kdf-builds.web.app` — that is **Firebase**, a different
> target. If you published to R2 only, Firebase cannot serve your commit. Either
> deploy to both (`--provider all`) or make sure the R2 host is in `source_urls`
> (step 4).

---

## 4. Point the SDK at the new artifact

Edit `sdk/packages/komodo_defi_framework/app_build/build_config.json`:

* `api.api_commit_hash` → the full commit SHA
* `api.branch` → the branch name
* `api.platforms.<each>.valid_zip_sha256_checksums` → the new checksums
* `api.source_urls` → must contain the host you actually published to

**Take the checksums from the manifest, not from the build log.** A single
mistyped checksum fails the download at verification with an error that looks
like a network problem:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
man = json.load(open('../nitride-kdf-builds/public/<safe-branch>/manifest.json'))
by = {a['platform']: a for a in man['artifacts']}
p = 'sdk/packages/komodo_defi_framework/app_build/build_config.json'
cfg = json.load(open(p)); api = cfg['api']
api['api_commit_hash'] = man['commit']
api['branch'] = man['branch']
missing = [k for k in api['platforms'] if k not in by]
assert not missing, f"manifest missing platforms: {missing}"
for name, entry in api['platforms'].items():
    entry['valid_zip_sha256_checksums'] = [by[name]['sha256']]
with open(p, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(cfg, f, indent=2); f.write('\n')
print('updated to', man['commit'][:7])
PY
```

> **Watch `bundled_coins_repo_commit` in the same file.** The build transformer
> rewrites it to whatever the coins repo currently points at, on every build and
> every `flutter test`. That is a separate concern from the KDF artifact — leave
> it at its committed value unless you *intend* to ship new coin definitions,
> otherwise an unrelated coins bump rides along in your diff.

---

## 5. Fetch and verify

The transformer only runs during a **real asset build**. `--config-only` does
not trigger it.

```bash
rm -f sdk/packages/komodo_defi_framework/macos/bin/kdf   # force a refetch
flutter build web --release \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_ENABLED=true \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_RECEIVE_ENABLED=true \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_BASE_URL=<url> \
  --dart-define=TRON_GASLESS_SERVICE_PROVIDER=<address>
```

Then check what actually landed — do not assume:

```bash
sdk/packages/komodo_defi_framework/macos/bin/kdf --version
strings sdk/packages/komodo_defi_framework/web/kdf/bin/kdflib_bg.wasm \
  | grep -oE '3\.0\.0-beta_[a-f0-9]{7}' | sort -u
```

Both must report your commit's short SHA. On a deployed preview, the equivalent
check is to fetch the served wasm in the browser console and search it for the
version string — a 200 response only proves *something* is there.

---

## 6. Validate in the app

```bash
# Real KDF through the real SDK - the number the app actually experiences
cd sdk/packages/komodo_defi_harness
KDF_HARNESS=1 KDF_TEST_SEED='<throwaway seed>' \
  flutter test test/process/real_kdf_smoke_test.dart

# Suites
cd ../komodo_defi_sdk && flutter test
cd ../../.. && flutter test test_units/main.dart --dart-define=...   # the 4 GasFree defines
```

The process tier prints `PROCESS TIER (hd): ... activation_ms=... 
first_post_activation_balance_ms=...`. Compare against the numbers in
[`KDF_LATENCY_REPORT.md`](KDF_LATENCY_REPORT.md); the per-PR harness gate also
compares `first_post_activation_balance_ms` to `tool/bench_baseline.json` with a
30% regression threshold.

For KDF-in-isolation numbers (no Flutter, no Dart, no SDK), use
`tool/kdf_latency_probe.py` — see [`../tool/README.md`](../tool/README.md).

---

## Gotchas

Every one of these cost real time at least once.

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile` fails in CI, every job red before doing any work | `pubspec.lock` generated on a different Flutter than CI pins | regenerate with the pinned version — `fvm flutter pub get`. See [`FLUTTER_VERSION.md`](FLUTTER_VERSION.md) |
| `macos/Podfile.lock` drops from ~61 pods to ~5 | a `pod install` ran before plugin symlinks resolved | `git checkout -- macos/Podfile.lock`. Never commit it — the macOS build then fails to link Firebase, secure storage, local_auth… |
| `macos/Runner.xcodeproj` churns on every build, plus a new `Runner.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/` | Flutter auto-adds SwiftPM integration | `flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager` (per machine), revert the files |
| `403 rate limit exceeded` fetching `GLEECBTC/coins` | a step runs `flutter test`/asset transformer without `GITHUB_API_PUBLIC_READONLY_TOKEN` | set it from `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. **Presents as flake** — it passes until the runner's shared IP budget is spent |
| build refuses to start: "KDF worktree is dirty" | untracked or modified files in the KDF checkout | see the note in step 2 |
| downloaded artifact rejected | checksum in `build_config.json` does not match the published ZIP | re-derive from `manifest.json` (step 4) |
| a CI job shows "failure" but no step failed | it was **cancelled** by a newer push (concurrency) | check `.jobs[].conclusion == "cancelled"` before diagnosing |
| the build "never finishes" — no completion notice, hours pass | a watcher died (self-matching `pgrep -f`, or a shell that did not survive the session) while the `nohup`-ed build ran to a clean finish | `grep -c "Cleanup audit passed" "$LOG"`. **Absence of a notification is not evidence of progress** — see [Knowing when it finished](#knowing-when-it-finished) |
| `GITHUB_API_PUBLIC_READONLY_TOKEN` set but the transformer still gets `401`/`403` | exported in `~/.zshrc`, which zsh reads **only for interactive shells**, so no build script or tool shell sees it | move the export to `~/.zshenv`, which every zsh invocation reads. Passing it as an empty string is worse than not setting it — empty is sent as a credential and rejected `401` |

## Rolling back

The SDK's artifact reference is the only pointer, so a rollback is a revert of
`build_config.json` (commit hash, branch, seven checksums) to the previous
values, then a rebuild so the transformer refetches. Nothing needs to be
unpublished — R2 publication is additive and prior commits stay served.
