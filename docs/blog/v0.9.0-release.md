# Komodo Wallet 0.9.0 – HD Wallets and More

The 0.9.0 update for Komodo Wallet is a big leap forward. Here are the highlights from a user perspective.

## HD Wallet Everywhere
You can now manage hierarchical deterministic (HD) addresses, import existing seeds and withdraw from any derived account. Portfolio totals adjust automatically for each address you select.

## Seamless Fiat On‑Ramp
Buying crypto directly through the wallet is now possible on every platform thanks to the new Banxa integration and HD address support. Simply choose a payment method and follow the prompts.

## Custom Tokens
Need an ERC‑20 token that isn’t listed? The new **Import Token** workflow lets you add it manually in just a few steps.

## Feedback Built In
A revamped feedback system powered by BetterFeedback sends your comments straight to our Trello board so the team can track issues and feature requests.

## Private Key Access
For advanced users, private keys can be exported from settings. Be sure to keep them safe!

## Other Notable Changes
- Multi‑address faucet requests
- Cleaner unauthenticated asset list
- Updated coin icons with CDN fallback
- Faster coin list loading
- Many fixes around DEX trading, transaction history and system health checks

This release also upgrades the entire project to Flutter 3.29 and refreshes our build pipelines. Developers should review the [release notes](../RELEASE_NOTES_v0.9.0.md) for details on SDK migrations and other breaking changes.
