# v0.9.7 release candidate review

Initially reviewed on 2026-09-05 against [PR #3525](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/gleec-wallet/pull/3525); integration state refreshed on 2026-09-07.

## Current integration state

- SDK [PR #374](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/komodo-defi-sdk-flutter/pull/374) merged into `main` on 2026-09-07 at `4d386b0a710fd78aa4e5e0d782eb6d9e49d3e828`. The wallet now pins that `main` commit. Its complete Git tree is identical to the previously tested `a7abc2c00a35838c08fb4e4aacc728571f7e731f` snapshot; package versions remain SDK `0.8.0-rc.1` and local-auth `0.6.0-rc.1`.
- Wallet [PR #3528](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/gleec-wallet/pull/3528) includes `dev` through `042e68d1ed51d5cd12b7f6a220e5b35bfe105438`: Firebase startup #3520, inline legal acceptance #3527 and spacing #3529, and checkout/web updates #3514 (including #3526) are already merged into `dev`.
- Merging #3528 into `dev` brings the review corrections, SDK `main` pointer, and completed v0.9.7 changelog into RC #3525 automatically, because that PR compares `dev` with `main`. The RC description records this expected state while keeping #3528's merge and final release checks pending until completed.
- The KDF pin remains `f3efd2ca10420f2982fa127dde84dcc17891f577`. No SDK source, package version, storage format, or dependency-lockfile change is introduced by this pointer update.

Validation of the SDK `main` pointer on 2026-09-07, using Flutter `3.41.4`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Wallet unit/widget aggregator with all four GasFree defines | 826 passed, 3 skipped |
| Wallet dependency resolution with the enforced lockfile, offline | Passed; lockfile unchanged |
| CI static analysis | Passed; no errors, with 55 existing warnings and 2,119 information diagnostics |
| SDK merge tree compared with the previously tested `a7abc2c0` tree | Identical |
| Whitespace checks | Passed; no Dart source changed in this synchronization |

Build-generated coin configuration changes were restored. Earlier SDK suite,
browser, Wasm-build, and preview-smoke results below retain their original
scope. Final CI and release smoke testing must be confirmed on the resulting
`dev`/RC revision after #3528 merges.

The sections below retain the original review and validation history; earlier
commit pins and test counts identify the snapshots tested at those stages.

## Review basis

- Release base: `origin/main`, `07fc5bc5961e258399ad829c8c0784fcb27d4d53`.
- Review branch starts at `origin/dev`, `e1f7885d18a895ce443464d247349bcc31715522`.
- [PR #3514](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/gleec-wallet/pull/3514), head `8adb081f305e5e8a78fe5ce6eb36aba74931976e`, is squash-merged locally before the review fixes. This includes the web update changes from #3526.
- Original SDK release pin: `7dce2687276684c132a1d9e4702c7d5c541eba2a`; initial fixes are committed at `a9e3bde6`, followed by the verified-identity API correction at `51e4b56a7c0712711b0441d4c67d6d3a99332e97` and the Wasm activation race correction at `0c69c1b5d2e68225b8377e6a4099862f133727c3`, on SDK branch `fix/release-candidate-review-20260905`.
- Scope: the complete app release diff (409 files including #3514), the SDK roll's wallet identity/history/persistence and GasFree paths, native/Firebase configuration, build workflows, checkout scripts, and tests. Independent reviews covered transfers, receive/activation, onboarding, NFT/history, web/fiat, and the SDK, followed by a second review of the fixes.

## Findings addressed

| Finding | Trigger and correction |
| --- | --- |
| Saved-wallet Delete opened Login | The onboarding wrapper discarded the selected action. Carry the action through the manager constructors and test deletion/cancellation. |
| Mobile backup could trap the user | Reused settings pages omitted their mobile Back control inside the modal. Give the modal a Back action and allow seed controls to wrap at compact widths. Cancelling never grants the pending receive action. |
| Backup warnings crossed same-name wallets | An in-memory acknowledgement used the display name. Key it by full wallet identity and decline results from a replaced wallet. |
| Stale backup confirmation could update another wallet | Bind the confirmation event and metadata write to the original identity, including the check inside the authentication write lock. Close stale dialogs and discard late mnemonic results. |
| Failed address refresh remained loading | The error branch retained `submitting`. Emit failure and allow a later successful refresh to recover. |
| Re-enabling a hidden coin could remain activating | The activation bridge deduplicated a deliberate replay against an old retained active state. Force explicit snapshot replays while retaining ordinary event deduplication. |
| Resume could leave Receive without a subscription | A status-only refresh could not finish an interrupted initial subscription. Restart the subscription when status or watcher setup is incomplete. |
| Background revocation could be overwritten | A final awaited wallet check could outlive the request generation. Check generation again after the await before publishing ready state. |
| Custody copy could outlive validation | A backup prompt could stay open through expiry, revocation, or wallet replacement. Recheck wallet identity and current receive status immediately before clipboard access. |
| NFT activation requests crossed sessions | Old authentication or activation completions could start stale work or release a newer session's chain claim. Use session-owned claims and guards after awaits. |
| Temporary identity failure disconnected history | Name-only identity events for the same authenticated wallet cleared history streams and changed storage namespace. Preserve the verified identity for these degraded events. |
| Old activation polluted another wallet's history state | An activation completion could populate the next wallet's per-session marker before identity validation. Validate before adding the marker. |
| Merged history could attach to the next wallet | The historical-to-live transition could retain the previous wallet's rows while opening another wallet's stream. Keep one wallet context across the entire merged stream. |
| Consolidation fee shortages looked like connection failures | Map typed insufficient-gas/fee-balance errors to the existing TRX funding guidance; keep unknown and transport errors blocked. |
| Bitrefill bridge accepted unauthenticated incoming messages | Require the exact provider origin and active iframe window; ignore malformed payloads. This hardens a pre-existing boundary touched by #3514. Execute tests against the actual JavaScript asset in CI. |
| Web update popup could describe an unavailable release | A newer deployed version was accepted even when still older than the announcement. Require deployment to satisfy the announced release as well as improve on the running version. |

The release notes now include #3514/#3526, the already-merged Firebase startup fix #3520, and the review corrections.

## Initial review validation

Flutter is pinned to `3.41.4`; the app test suite uses all four mandatory `TRON_GASLESS_*` defines from `docs/TESTING.md`. SDK tests keep `KDF_HARNESS` empty and the replay harness uses fake RPC transport.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| App unit/widget aggregator, `test_units/main.dart` | 771 passed, 3 skipped |
| `komodo_defi_sdk` full package suite | 872 passed, 1 skipped |
| `komodo_defi_local_auth` full package suite | 60 passed |
| Wallet-load replay harness, HD and iguana | 30 passed, 4 process-tier tests skipped |
| Wallet-load benchmark and committed 30% regression gate | Passed; measured deltas from -0.4% to +0.7% |
| Actual Bitrefill JavaScript asset tests | 13 passed; registered in code-guidelines CI |
| Hosting URL, GasFree configuration, preview provenance shell tests | All passed |
| CI analysis: `flutter analyze --no-pub --no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos` | Passed, no errors; existing warning/information diagnostics remain |
| Release web build with all four GasFree defines | Passed, including Flutter's Wasm dry run |
| Formatting of changed Dart files and whitespace checks | Passed |

The build-generated coin configuration change was restored; the KDF binary pin remains unchanged. The app and SDK fixes are committed separately. The SDK branch is published in [PR #374](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/komodo-defi-sdk-flutter/pull/374), targeting `main` as a release-line hotfix.

## Follow-up: verified identity is required for metadata writes

[Review comment #3941129166](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/komodo-defi-sdk-flutter/pull/374#discussion_r3941129166) is valid: an unavailable identity RPC produces a name-only `WalletId`. Equality alone accepts a different seed recreated under the same name while that outage persists. Both regression cases (key update and whole-map replacement) fail with the old equality-only guard and pass with the corrected guard.

All SDK metadata setters and atomic updates now require `expectedWalletId`. Both the expected and freshly resolved identities must contain a nonblank public-key hash and compare equal under the authentication write lock. Rejection occurs before the transform or metadata write and does not sign out the replacement session. This is an explicitly accepted breaking API change; migration guidance and unreleased changelog entries accompany it. Package version assignment, tags, and publishing remain release-preparation work.

The app carries the original identity through backup confirmation, wallet export, registration/restore finalizers, metadata repair, hardware-wallet setup, asset activation, legacy migration, and rollback. Export captures identity before the password prompt and checks it around mnemonic retrieval and file saving. Stale migration and ZHTLC completion stop without altering the replacement session. Identity-unavailable activation becomes suspended, with session-generation checks preventing a late cancellation from changing a newer login.

Validation of the follow-up with Flutter `3.41.4`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| App unit/widget aggregator with all four GasFree defines | 784 passed, 3 skipped |
| `komodo_defi_sdk` full package suite | 872 passed, 1 skipped |
| `komodo_defi_local_auth` full package suite | 74 passed |
| Replay harness, excluding benchmark tests | 28 passed, 3 process-tier skips |
| CI-equivalent app and local-auth analysis | No errors; existing diagnostics remain |
| Changed-file formatting and whitespace checks | Passed |

The initial benchmark, script, and release web-build results above predate this follow-up; those checks were not rerun for the metadata API migration.

## Follow-up: activation completion must recheck the session synchronously

[Review comment #3941224671](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/komodo-defi-sdk-flutter/pull/374#discussion_r3941224671) is valid on WebAssembly. Its async-return completion can yield after wallet A passes identity validation. A queued authentication event then switches to wallet B and clears the activation markers, before A's continuation adds its marker to B's session. B's next history request incorrectly skips activation.

The SDK now checks wallet identity, session generation, and disposal synchronously immediately before adding the marker. The authoritative asynchronous identity check remains. Two regressions using ordinary queued microtasks both fail against the previous implementation in Chrome/Wasm (one activation instead of two) and pass with the guard. Native execution alone does not expose this timing gap. CI now runs the complete wallet-race test file in Wasm, with software WebGL enabled only in its isolated test browser.

Validation at SDK commit `0c69c1b5d2e68225b8377e6a4099862f133727c3`, using Flutter `3.41.4`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Wallet-history race suite in Chrome/Wasm | 8 passed; both new regressions failed before the fix |
| Full SDK package suite on the native VM | 874 passed, 1 skipped |
| App unit/widget aggregator with all four GasFree defines | 784 passed, 3 skipped |
| Replay harness, excluding benchmark tests | 28 passed, 3 process-tier skips |
| Analysis of changed SDK Dart files | No errors; 18 existing information diagnostics |
| Changed-file formatting, whitespace, shell syntax, workflow YAML | Passed |

The local-auth code is unchanged by this correction; its 74-test result above remains the previous validation. The build-generated coin configuration change was restored again. The companion app now pins this SDK commit.

## Release boundaries

- The app review branch targets `dev` to feed RC #3525. SDK #374 has merged into SDK `main`; the wallet integration is still carried by #3528. Release tags, production deployment, and funded transfers remain separate release actions.
- Signed distribution and production rollout remain release actions. At wallet commit `2fdd6b166`, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, unit, replay/performance, and preview checks passed. The deployed Firebase preview passed startup/onboarding/cancellation smoke testing. The Chrome integration job failed; Safari reported success but its browser logs showed aborted suites, so neither is accepted as passing integration validation.
- Production-hosted wrapper protection reaches shipped native clients only when the updated wrapper and headers are actually deployed. The included deployment verifier checks that separate release action.

## RC package preparation

SDK commit `a7abc2c00a35838c08fb4e4aacc728571f7e731f` prepares
`komodo_defi_sdk` `0.8.0-rc.1` and `komodo_defi_local_auth` `0.6.0-rc.1`.
The SDK requires local-auth `^0.6.0-rc.1`. The root and package changelogs now
identify the RC versions and cover the metadata and history corrections, with
explicit prerelease installation and migration guidance. The wallet pins this
published Git commit; its lockfile changes only the two RC package versions.

Validation of this versioned snapshot:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Offline SDK workspace resolution | Passed |
| Wallet dependency resolution with enforced lockfile | Passed |
| Clean package publication dry-runs, SDK and local-auth | Both passed with zero warnings |
| Full SDK package suite | 874 passed, 1 skipped |
| Full local-auth package suite | 74 passed |
| Wallet unit/widget aggregator with all four GasFree defines | 784 passed, 3 skipped |

The publication dry-runs report informational version-gap hints because pub.dev
has older releases than the repository. They do not upload packages or establish
that every transitive workspace package is already available on pub.dev.
Git-pinned wallet testing does not require package publication. Publishable RC
distribution requires confirming the complete dependency chain and publishing
local-auth before the SDK.

SDK PR #374 has merged, and the wallet is repinned to the resulting `main`
commit as recorded above. The merge preserves the tested SDK tree and package
versions, so the wallet lockfile needs no update. Synchronization of SDK `dev`,
tags, package uploads, signing, and production rollout remain separate release
actions after the reviewed RC is accepted.

## Follow-up: wallet import and trustworthy browser checks

This follow-up used the approved SDK `a7abc2c0` snapshot and changed only wallet
application code, wallet tests, and wallet documentation. The current SDK pin
is its tree-identical `main` merge commit, recorded above.

The import password step did not subscribe to password-validity updates, leaving
the button state stale. It now follows both password fields and resets validity
when navigating back. A widget regression covers empty, valid, mismatched, and
corrected confirmation values and fails against the previous implementation.

Browser validation also exposed stale test inputs: the old password contained
three identical characters in succession and was rejected by the existing app
and KDF policies. Test fixtures now meet that policy. Wallet-manager tests choose
the desktop or mobile connection control as appropriate and wait for password
validation to rebuild the import button. Feedback checks respect whether a
provider is configured and use the current feedback form.

Test-mode startup now preserves Flutter's test error handler and zone. Production
startup retains the application's error reporting. Three regression tests cover
framework errors, asynchronous startup failures, and production error routing.
With the old invalid password fixture still in place, a real Chrome/profile run
of `misc_tests` now failed with `TimeoutException: Pump until has timed out` and
exit code 1, confirming that the aborted test is no longer reported as a pass.

Validation with Flutter `3.41.4`:

- Wallet unit/widget aggregator: **788 passed, 3 skipped**, with all four GasFree defines.
- Full wallet analysis: no errors; existing warning/information diagnostics remain.
- Chrome/profile `misc_tests`: passed, including wallet restoration, theme and
  feedback checks, and navigation; `END MISC TESTS` and successful process exit
  both confirmed.
- Chrome/profile `wallets_manager_tests`: passed, including create, logout, and
  import; `END WALLET MANAGER TESTS` and successful process exit both confirmed.
- The complete CI browser matrix still needs validation on the pushed follow-up;
  these two targeted suites do not establish that the other suites pass.

No additional SDK change is part of this follow-up. Any further SDK change
requires explicit approval and must be necessary for this release.

## Synchronization with the updated dev branch

During validation, `dev` advanced to `4744957b4` with PR #3527's inline legal
acceptance changes. The review branch merges that commit and retains both its
legal-acceptance coverage and the review's wallet-deletion, import-validation,
and test-error regressions. The import regression now uses the shared legal
onboarding test harness. The SDK pin remains `a7abc2c0`.

The combined wallet unit/widget aggregator passes **825 tests, with 3 skipped**,
using all four GasFree defines. Full analysis reports no errors and the same
existing diagnostics. Browser and release-build results for this combined
snapshot are recorded in PR #3528.
